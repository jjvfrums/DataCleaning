##Code Book For Final_Dataset.txt

The Final_Dataset.txt contains Mean for an observation value for a particular type of activity for a particular test subject. The dataset has the following variables. Subject ID represent the test subject. Activity ID represents the Activity Type. The remaining variable provide the name of the variable whose average has been recorded for the combination of subject ID and activity ID. There are 30 subject ID is total and 6 activity types.
